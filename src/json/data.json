This polished alloy fronted, extruded aluminium box contains a 27mm Alps Blue Velvet motorised potentiometer alongside two gold plated relays for source switching and a muting relay that shorts the signal to ground when active. None of the relays are in the signal path. A micro controller decodes the infra-red signals from the SRC2 handset, and turns itself off after each operation to avoid any sonic degradation.",

The P3 has a high-resolution headphone section, as well as features not found on most audiophile products, for instance an RS-232 port, an IR input and output jacks. The P3 is clearly an audiophile product with home theaters and system integration in mind, making it a more modern and forward-thinking piece of kit than the competition.",

            "description":"Pre Box S2 Digital marks a new era for our S-series components. For the very first time we are using a dual mono configuration with the highest class D/A converters of ESS Sabre. Their flagship DAC-chip ensures highest class audio in a small and affordable package. This DAC is capable of high resolution audio up to 32bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512! Pre Box S2 Digital is also the very first of our devices to support hardware MQA unfolding. It’s also the premiere of our proprietary Optimum transient digital filter and our proprietary clock circuitry design. Digital audio is the art of time, with our new proprietary clock design we have managed jitter rates of unrivalled 100 Femtoseconds, this easily outperforms many renowned and respected audiophile clock generators!",
